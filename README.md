# NTeleportation-Blocking
A Rust (Video Game) plugin that is based on the NTeleportation plugin from uMod made by nivex.


# NTeleportationFriends.cs
The plugin titled "NTeleportationFriends.cs" is just a slight change in the code from NTeleportation plugin that allows you to have blocked users not being able to teleport to you. This comes from my [Friends-or-BlockedUsers-Plugin](https://github.com/ViolationHandler-exe/Friends-or-BlockedUsers-Plugin) plugin which is a modified version of the [Friends plugin](https://umod.org/plugins/friends) made by [MrBlue](https://umod.org/user/MrBlue) at uMod.

The uploaded first copy will be the original copy of NTeleporation, and the edited/committed version will be my implementation/version. This allows you to compare what my edits are in comparison to the original copy.


# NTeleportationIgnore.cs

The plugin titled "NTeleportationBlocked.cs" is just a slight change in the code from NTeleportation plugin that allows you to have blocked users not being able to teleport to you.
